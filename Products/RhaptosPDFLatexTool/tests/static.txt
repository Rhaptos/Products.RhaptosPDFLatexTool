Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.RhaptosPDFLatexTool.PDFLatexTool import PDFLatexTool
    >>> PDFLatexTool.id == 'portal_pdflatex'
    True
    >>> PDFLatexTool.meta_type == 'PDFLatex Tool'
    True
    >>> type(PDFLatexTool.__implements__)
    <class 'Interface._InterfaceClass.Interface'>
